State management : It is a mechanism to deploy application level security and user tracking in application. This can be implemented in application by two ways

-> session management : It is a server side mechanism to implement state management , session is a storage on server side used to store details of users on server side to apply security and tracking

install module : express-session 

app.js

var session=require('express-session')
app.use(session({'secret':'my pet name is shanky'}))


-> cookie management : It is client side mechanism to implement state, management , as cookie is a client side storage used to store details on client end (web browser).

As data is on client end may leads to carry out security conerns , hence cookies is used for user tracking not to implement security
